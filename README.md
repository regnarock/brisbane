## Project's structure
This project structure is based on [The hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/).

## Python version and virtualenv
This project runs with Python 3.6.7 and was used along [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and its plugin
[pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)

Once the two are installed, you can simply run the following in the project's root:
```
make init
```
